<!-- To do

1. Create structure
2. Write the first draft for each section
3. Add visualisations where there aren't any
4. Tighten up script
5. Fix anything that looks wrong visually

## Code of Conduct

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Expected behaviours: {.smaller}

- Be respectful of differing opinions and experiences.
- Participate in an authentic and active way.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Accept responsibility and apologise to those affected.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

#### Unacceptable behaviours: {.smaller}

- Discriminatory jokes and language.
- Sustained disruption of community events.

## Learning objectives

- To expand the definition of "research outputs"
- To define the FAIR principles
- To demonstrate how to use a repository for archiving research outputs
- To explain how to choose a repository
- To explain the available licences

**By the end of the workshop, you will be able to use a repository to archive research output in a FAIR manner**.

## Advertising scholarship

> An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely **advertising** of the scholarship.

## The actual scholarship

The actual outputs created during a research project will differ but some examples include:

- Preregistrations
- Presentations and posters on your findings
- Datasets
- Protocols and workflows
- Code (analysis scripts and software packages)
- Outputs related to other aspects of your work, e.g. educational materials

## Why share all these other outputs?

1. It allows verification of research and builds trust
2. It avoids duplication of effort and accelerates science
3. It is good for you as a researcher

## What to share?

The more you can share the better, within reason.

- At a minimum, you should share the data and code needed to confirm your findings.
- Additionally, a lot of work goes into creating the datasets themselves, e.g. code lists, experimental protocols, consent forms.

**Don't worry that your outputs aren't important! You never know what will end up being useful for others!**

## Example

## What (not) to share

The more you can share the better, [**within reason**]{style="color:#F2B705"}.

- Anything that you found online that isn't licensed for reuse - *more on licences later*!
- An obvious issue is personal data, especially sensitive personal data - *more on this later*!
- Confidential data that's commercially sensitive or relevant for national security - talk to the data provider about what you **can** share.
- Really big data (e.g. in quantum computing, cosmology) - think about what data is **necessary** and whether the data can be recreated.

## How to share?

## Findable: Metadata :mag:

First people need to be able to find your outputs!

. . .

For outputs to be findable, they need to be described with **rich metadata**.
These metadata can be generic (e.g. title, author name, keywords) or discipline-specific.

## Findable: Persistent identifiers :mag:

::: {.column width="50%"}
Outputs should also be assigned a **unique and persistent identifier**, e.g. a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).
:::

![](DOI.jpg){.absolute top=150 right=50 width="450" height="304"}

. . .

::: {.column width="50%"}
Such identifiers make it easy to find outputs, but also to link them with other relevant information (e.g. a publication).
:::

## Findable: Persistent identifiers for people :mag:

Persistent identifiers for researchers help if you have a common name or if you change your name!

![](OrcidIDs.jpg)
## Task 1

Create an ORCID iD

1. Navigate to https://orcid.org/ on your browser
2. Select Sign in/Register and then Register as a new user
3. Fill in the information required


## Accessible: Define processes :door:

After people have found your outputs they need to be able to access them!
This could mean that they are publicly available in a **repository**.

. . .

<br>

### :warning: Sensitive information

Most of you will be working with sensitive personal data that need to stay restricted :locked:

. . .

<br>

In those cases, the **metadata should still be accessible**.


## Interoperable :gear:

Research outputs often need to be integrated with other data.

This integration is easier when data make reference to other **relevant datasets**.

. . .

<br>

It's also important to make data available in **open file formats**, that anyone can open.

. . .

<br>

Using **controlled vocabularies** is also highly recommended, if these exist in your field.

## Where to share?

```{mermaid}

  A(Supplementary materials) --> B(Specialised or generic repository) --> C(Data or software article) 
```

## Where to share: Supplementary materials

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A(Supplementary materials) --> B(Specialised or generic repository) --> C(Data or software article) 
```

Including them in supplementary materials is the **most common** way in which researchers share data.
Although this may make sense for some disciplines, it is not suitable for many others.

## Where to share: Repositories (discipline-specific or generic)

```{mermaid}

```

## Discipline-specific repositories


## Examples of discipline-specific repositories: Medical data


## Examples of discipline-specific repositories: Social Sciences data


## Examples of discipline-specific repositories: Protocols



## Generic repositories


## Zenodo


## Demo of data upload


## Where to share: Data or software paper
